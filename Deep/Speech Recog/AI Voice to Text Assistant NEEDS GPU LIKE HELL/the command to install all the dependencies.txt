pip install -r requirements.txt

this command will download all the dependencies that are mentioned in requirement.txt 
make sure that requirement.txt is there within ur project folder 

and also before running the pip install command download GIT not GITHUB or GITHUB DESKTOP but just GIT 
so that it can download all dependencies without any issue..... 

also this is someone else project and requires a lot of GPU power if not given the project might be laggy
